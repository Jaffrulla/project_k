                give an idea about how others feel about those restaurants. 
                We aim to provide all the reviews and ratings of the
                restaurants given by our Users. Any of our users can access reviews of all  available restaurants and submit their
                own reviews and ratings out of 5 for any of the dishes. Users can also review the entire restaurant and 
                submit their opinions about any of the other features of the restaurant like 'Hospitality', 'Ambiance', 
                'Vehicle Parking', 'Location availability', 'Timings' etc.

                       forward to increase our scope for other stores like Medical Stores, Event Organizers, Doctors, 
                       General Stores, and others if this website could reach your hearts. We follow a strict process for both user and restaurant registrations
                       without any leakages.
